1. Consolidate common README text into ports/README.rst
this bit:
"""
...Before building the firmware for a given board...
git submodule update --init --recursive
make -C mpy-cross
"""

2. Why doesn't make do
make deplibs
isn't that the point of make?

side note: make will build ok with just
make axtls


3. Welcome banner should say CircuitPython:

currently:
circuitpython/ports/unix/build/genhdr$ ack MicroPython
qstr.i.last
619974:    mp_hal_stdout_tx_str("MicroPython " "4.0.0-alpha.5-28-gca60a034c-dirty" " on " "2018-12-20" "; "

circuitpython/ports/unix$ ./micropython
MicroPython 4.0.0-alpha.5-28-gca60a034c on 2018-12-19; linux version

but this works:
>>> sys.implementation
(name='circuitpython', version=(4, 0, 0))


4. I'm not sure this is relevant for linux, but about fpga Dan says:

"... it doesn't include all the CircuitPython-specific stuff like GPIO and peripheral support. You might want to start with ports/atmel-samd and gut the common-hal part and replace it with what works..."
